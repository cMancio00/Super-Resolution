# Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network is a deep learning architecture which use **convolution** as activation functions. These kind of network are used with images and sequences.

We will use this architecture to build a Super-Resolution Network using the methods explained in [How to build a Deep Neural Network](/docs/DeepNeuralNetwork.md#how-to-build-a-deep-neural-network)
